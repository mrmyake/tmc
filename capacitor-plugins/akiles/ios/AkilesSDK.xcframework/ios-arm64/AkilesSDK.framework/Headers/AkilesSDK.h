/**
 * @file AkilesSDK.h
 * @brief Main header file for the AkilesSDK
 *
 * The AkilesSDK provides a comprehensive interface for iOS applications to interact
 * with Akiles. This includes online and offline open, NFC card operations and session management.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - Session management with the Akiles API
 * - Opening Akiles devices online and offline
 * - NFC card scanning and updating
 *
 * ## Getting Started
 * 1. Import the framework: `#import <AkilesSDK/AkilesSDK.h>`
 * 2. Create an Akiles instance: `Akiles *akiles = [[Akiles alloc] init];`
 * 3. Add a session token from the Akiles API
 * 4. Discover and interact with Akiles devices
